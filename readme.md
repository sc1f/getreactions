# counts most liked memes from UT meme page

someone help me write this in better than brute force iterative time (o(n)? idk i'm not a CS major)

* memescount.py = the counter
* output.txt = full output
* output.py = top 10 liked posts
* meme_ids = 2459 post_ids of memes on the page
* reactions = 2459 lines of reactions for each meme_id provided

please don't ask me why i did this
